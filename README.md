2. Using your forked copy of the repo, git clone it to your local environment
3. Set up your own developer branch of the HumanResources repo. Make sure this repo is something distinct and identifiable to you (If you're working on the dodge mechanic, name it [username]DodgeFix or something to this effect).
4. [Download and install Godot, the open source software development tool](https://godotengine.org/download/windows/#platforms)
5. Open your local copy of the HumanResources repo in Godot and make your changes! Save early and often!
6. When you're finished with your changes, and you've ensured it functions as intended using unit tests, add, commit, and push your changes to the branch.
7. Create a pull request on your forked repo. It should automatically target the head directory and will allow people to review your changes. When making a pull request, make sure to add a descriptive but distinct title, a summary of the state of the specific part of the code base before and after you made your changes, and a general idea of what your goal for the PR is. Tag any of the main collaborators in the PR, so we can take a look at your changes.
